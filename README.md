# SQL-Advanced-Data-Analyst-Project

This project is the final installment in a three-part SQL-based data analysis workflow, where I apply advanced SQL techniques to perform analytical queries on a data warehouse. It builds upon the foundations created in the following two earlier projects:

- 🏗 [SQL Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/AHMED-AHMED-KHAMIS/sql-data-warehouse-project): Designed and built the data warehouse from raw CSV data using SQL Server.
- 📊 [EDA Analysis Project](https://github.com/AHMED-AHMED-KHAMIS/EDA-Analysis-Project): Conducted exploratory data analysis on the warehouse to uncover initial patterns and trends.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for all three projects in this repository can be found here:
🔗 [Dataset Folder](https://github.com/AHMED-AHMED-KHAMIS/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main/Dataset)

This folder contains all CSV files and relevant data used across the projects. Feel free to explore or download them for your own analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I use **Advanced SQL Queries** to derive business insights and perform comprehensive data analysis using the star schema structure in the `gold` layer of the data warehouse.

The analysis focuses on sales trends, customer behavior, performance indicators, segmentation, and category contributions.
